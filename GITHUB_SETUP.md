# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your Snake Game project on GitHub with all the professional files and structure we've created.

## 📁 Current Project Structure

Your project now has the following structure:

```

```

## 🚀 Steps to Publish on GitHub

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Snake Game v1.0.0

- Classic terminal-based snake game
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Professional project structure
- Complete documentation
- CI/CD pipeline setup"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon and select "New repository"
3. Name it `snake-game` (or your preferred name)
4. Make it **Public** (recommended for open source)
5. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snake-game.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Update Repository Settings

After pushing, update these files with your information:

#### Update `setup.py`
```python
# Change these lines in setup.py:
author="Your Name",
author_email="your.email@example.com",
url="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snake-game",
```

#### Update `README.md`
```markdown
# Change this line in README.md:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snake-game.git
```

#### Update `LICENSE`
```text
# Change this line in LICENSE:
Copyright (c) 2024 Your Name
```

### 5. Enable GitHub Features

#### GitHub Actions
- Go to your repository → Actions tab
- The CI/CD pipeline should automatically start working
- You may need to enable Actions in repository settings

#### Issues and Projects
- Enable Issues in repository settings
- Create labels for bug reports, feature requests, etc.

#### Wiki (Optional)
- Enable Wiki in repository settings for additional documentation

### 6. Create First Release

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Initial release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then on GitHub:
1. Go to Releases tab
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Select the v1.0.0 tag
4. Add release notes based on CHANGELOG.md
